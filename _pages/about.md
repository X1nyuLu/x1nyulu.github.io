I am now a Ph.D. student in Shanghai Innovation Institute, advised by [Prof. Bin Ren](https://bren.xmu.edu.cn)(College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University) and [Prof. Rong-Rong Ji](https://mac.xmu.edu.cn/rrji_en/)(School of Informatics, Xiamen University). 
I received my M.S. degree in Physical Chemistry from Xiamen University in 2023.
